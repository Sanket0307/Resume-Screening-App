# Resume-Screening-App
This model is a Resume Screening and Summarization application designed to streamline the recruitment process by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It extracts text from resumes (in PDF or text format), cleans and processes the data, and summarizes key information using pre-trained NLP models from Hugging Face. The cleaned and summarized text is then classified into relevant job categories using a machine learning model trained with TensorFlow and scikit-learn. Built with an interactive Streamlit interface, the application allows users to upload resumes, view summarized content, and receive real-time job category predictions. The model utilizes CUDA for efficient GPU acceleration, ensuring optimized performance during processing.
